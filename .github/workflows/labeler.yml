  # use pull_request_target here to label PRs. from the documentation:
  #
  # "This event runs in the context of the base of the pull request, rather
  # than in the context of the merge commit, as the pull_request event does"
  # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request_target
  #
  # this workflow is potentially dangerous because the workflow has access to
  # GitHub APIs, i.e. secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN, and the author of PRs, who might
  # not be a member of the repository, can modify the workflow.

  pull_request_target:

# this workflow needs write access to PRs because it add labels to PRs, or
# remove labels from PRs.
